# Welcome to NEO

We were looking for interesting APIs that would allow us to build something cool, 
and we stumbled upon [NASA's Open APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html).

This project first started as a way to showcase liteByte's frontend abilities, 
but we quickly grew fond of it. We hope that this little thing we built will be
more than just a demo in the future.

A special thanks to NASA for collaborating with the open source community.

Feel free to look through the code, download it or visit the [live site](https://murmuring-fjord-10476.herokuapp.com/).
